# Pet Shop Truffle

Project made by: Safa Laabidi, Ines Achour, Amal Sammari

## I-Introduction
In this Project we are going to use Truffle, Ganache and Metamask.
Let's start by introducing them.

- Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum that simplifies contract creation, testing and deployment.

- Ethereum is a blockchain for smart contracts and decentralized apps with its cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).

- Ganache is a local blockchain simulator for Ethereum development.

- MetaMask is a browser extension for Ethereum DApps and wallet functionality.

## II-Implementation

### 1-Set Up

As mentioned in the tutorial, we started by making sure that we already have Node.js, npm and git in our system.

After that we install Truffle using npm :
> npm install -g truffle

Now we execute this command to get a basic project structure for our pet shop with the user interface :
> truffle unbox pet-shop

### 2- Project Implementation

Now let the serious part begin.
We are going to create a smart contract which is automated, code-based agreements on a blockchain that execute predefined actions when conditions are met, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
